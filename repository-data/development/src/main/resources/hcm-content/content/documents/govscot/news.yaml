              <p>Health board boundaries will be aligned with local authority areas to help ensure older people can receive the care they need at home.<br />
              <br />
              Speaking today in parliament, Health Secretary Alex Neil revealed that catchment areas for health boards will be realigned with council boundaries, to help them work closer together in the provision of care in the local community.<br />
              <br />
              The announcement comes the week after a new bill designed to ensure that the health and social care systems work together effectively to improve the provision of care in our communities was published.<br />
              <br />
              Mr Neil said:<br />
              <br />
              “People in Scotland are living longer, healthier lives and this means that services need to adapt in order to meet the challenges of a rapidly ageing population.<br />
              <br />
              “That is why we are bringing health and social care together, to improve care for people in communities, helping to anticipate their needs and reaching them before they need to be admitted to hospital or institutional care.<br />
              <br />
              “However, any mismatch of health board and local authority boundaries presents an administrative barrier to closer integrated working, complicating the planning and delivery of health and social care services.<br />
              <br />
              “We want to ensure that the responsibility for delivering health care matches the geographical boundaries of local authority partners.<br />
              <br />
              “These changes will help improve the quality and consistency of care for older people and people with complex care needs.”<br />
              <br />
              The boundary changes will come into effect from April 2014.<br />
              <br />
              These are administrative changes and patients will stay with the same GP practice and continue to receive treatment in their local hospital, even if their catchment area has changed</p>

              vibrant places where local people and visitors alike want to spend their
              time and money. They should be accessible places which invite business
              start-ups and inspire innovative ideas from all walks of the community.  The

              of our communities, functioning as places of social interaction and
              enterprise. By diversifying our high streets we will make them even
              better places to live, work and socialise.</p><p>“I look forward to
              the next phase of the work getting underway, with the first step being
              a government action plan in the autumn which will take forward the Expert
              Groups recommendation.” </p><p>Chairman of the National Review of Town
              Centres Malcolm Fraser said:</p><p>“Our Review offers the Scottish Government,
              and the people of Scotland, a range of measures to bring investment
              and footfall into the heart of our communities. </p><p>"Town centres
              offer a rich mix of live, work and play and we want to enhance that
              bustle and diversity: more people living there, encouragement for communities,
              businesses and local authorities and supportive planning and digital
              initiatives. There''s wide agreement on the need for action and optimism
              that the changes proposed can help foster a renewed sense of community
              and enterprise.” </p><p>Welcoming the report, Society of Chief Officers
              of Transportation in Scotland (SCOTS) Chairman, Ewan Wallace said:</p><p>"SCOTS
              welcomes the publication of the Town Centres Review report and the indication
              that the professional associations for Transportation and Planning will
              have a key role in contributing to any further work on town centre futures
              and planning for change.   </p><p>“The report highlights the critical
              role of effective and sustainable accessibility and connectivity in
              ensuring that our town centres are economically and socially vibrant
              places.  SCOTS has undertaken and contributed to a wide range of relevant
              policy and technical research and guidance, including Designing Streets
              and recent production of a  supporting Roads Development Guide.   </p><p>"We
              look forward to working with Scottish Government and other partners
              in developing these and other aspects of the Town Centres report and
              recommendations."</p><p>Commenting on the release of the Scottish Town
              Centre Review, Alasdair Morrison, Associate at GVA Property Consultancy
              and a member of the Scottish Government’s External Advisory Group for
              the National Review of Scottish Town Centres said:</p><p>“It has been
              a privilege to have had the opportunity to contribute in an advisory
              capacity to the Scottish Government’s National Review of Town Centres.
              I am pleased to see that the recommendations encourage the public sector,
              in particular, to take a more proactive and strategic approach. They
              have a vital role to play in regenerating our town centres.      </p><p>“However,
              new developments are often difficult to get off the ground, or stall,
              because of problems with development finance. The Review makes a number
              of recommendations in this respect. We now have an unprecedented opportunity
              for all interested parties to work together to ensure our town centres
              not only survive, but thrive.”</p><div class="notes-to-editors"><b>Notes

              <p>Legislation to create a new national qualifications body and an independent inspectorate of schools and other educational providers has been published.</p>
              <p>The Education (Scotland) Bill includes provisions to replace the Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA) with a new national qualifications body, Qualifications Scotland.</p>
              <p>If passed by the Scottish Parliament, the legislation will also establish the office of His Majesty’s Chief Inspector of Education in Scotland, with enhanced independence, to undertake the education inspection functions which currently sit within Education Scotland.</p>
              <p>While not part of the Bill provisions, Education Scotland’s role as the national education agency is also to be refocussed as part of the reform process - including taking a lead on curriculum design, delivery and improvement which will cover the provision of resources to support high quality learning and teaching.</p>
              <p>Education Secretary Jenny Gilruth said:</p>
              <p>"I am determined to drive further improvements across Scotland’s schools, and the changes being set out in this Bill will strengthen the national education landscape to better support pupils and teachers.</p>
              <p>"The governance processes for the new national qualifications body will ensure the knowledge and&nbsp;experience of pupils and teachers are central to decisions taken on qualifications and assessment.</p>
              <p>"Greater independence for the new inspectorate body will see the power to set the frequency and focus for inspections moving from Scottish Ministers to His Majesty’s Chief Inspector. &nbsp;This is a significant change and will &nbsp;increase confidence in the independent role of inspections in assessing and identifying strengths and areas for improvement across our education system.</p>
              <p>"The Scottish Government’s programme of education and skills reform will drive improvement right across the education system. That's why we've taken time to engage with learners, teachers and other professionals across the education and skills sector to ensure these changes meet the needs of future generations."</p>
              <p><strong>Background</strong></p>
              <p>The <a href="https://www.parliament.scot/bills-and-laws/bills/education-scotland-bill">Education (Scotland) Bill</a>&nbsp; will see Qualifications Scotland replace the SQA and it is expected to become operational in Autumn 2025. The Bill creates strengthened governance arrangements and increased accountability to learners and to the teaching profession. It places a requirement on Qualifications Scotland to establish dedicated committees for learners and for teachers, and for it to create two specific “charters” to set out what learners and teachers should expect from Qualifications Scotland to ensure its processes are fair and transparent and that the organisation can be held to account by those it serves.</p>
              <p>Once appointed, HM Chief Inspector, will lead the new education inspectorate, which is expected to become operational in Autumn 2025. The new inspectorate will operate independently, but it is intended that Scottish Ministers will retain oversight authority and Ministers will be able to request inspections are carried out by the Chief Inspector.</p>
              <p>The <a href="https://www.parliament.scot/chamber-and-committees/questions-and-answers/question?ref=S6W-28044">revised remit of Education Scotland</a>, which is not part of the Bill’s provisions, will see it continue as the national education agency.</p>

              <p>Legislation to create a new national qualifications body and an independent inspectorate of schools and other educational providers has been published.</p>
              <p>The Education (Scotland) Bill includes provisions to replace the Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA) with a new national qualifications body, Qualifications Scotland.</p>
              <p>If passed by the Scottish Parliament, the legislation will also establish the office of His Majesty’s Chief Inspector of Education in Scotland, with enhanced independence, to undertake the education inspection functions which currently sit within Education Scotland.</p>
              <p>While not part of the Bill provisions, Education Scotland’s role as the national education agency is also to be refocussed as part of the reform process - including taking a lead on curriculum design, delivery and improvement which will cover the provision of resources to support high quality learning and teaching.</p>
              <p>Education Secretary Jenny Gilruth said:</p>
              <p>"I am determined to drive further improvements across Scotland’s schools, and the changes being set out in this Bill will strengthen the national education landscape to better support pupils and teachers.</p>
              <p>"The governance processes for the new national qualifications body will ensure the knowledge and&nbsp;experience of pupils and teachers are central to decisions taken on qualifications and assessment.</p>
              <p>"Greater independence for the new inspectorate body will see the power to set the frequency and focus for inspections moving from Scottish Ministers to His Majesty’s Chief Inspector. &nbsp;This is a significant change and will &nbsp;increase confidence in the independent role of inspections in assessing and identifying strengths and areas for improvement across our education system.</p>
              <p>"The Scottish Government’s programme of education and skills reform will drive improvement right across the education system. That's why we've taken time to engage with learners, teachers and other professionals across the education and skills sector to ensure these changes meet the needs of future generations."</p>
              <p><strong>Background</strong></p>
              <p>The <a href="https://www.parliament.scot/bills-and-laws/bills/education-scotland-bill">Education (Scotland) Bill</a>&nbsp; will see Qualifications Scotland replace the SQA and it is expected to become operational in Autumn 2025. The Bill creates strengthened governance arrangements and increased accountability to learners and to the teaching profession. It places a requirement on Qualifications Scotland to establish dedicated committees for learners and for teachers, and for it to create two specific “charters” to set out what learners and teachers should expect from Qualifications Scotland to ensure its processes are fair and transparent and that the organisation can be held to account by those it serves.</p>
              <p>Once appointed, HM Chief Inspector, will lead the new education inspectorate, which is expected to become operational in Autumn 2025. The new inspectorate will operate independently, but it is intended that Scottish Ministers will retain oversight authority and Ministers will be able to request inspections are carried out by the Chief Inspector.</p>
              <p>The <a href="https://www.parliament.scot/chamber-and-committees/questions-and-answers/question?ref=S6W-28044">revised remit of Education Scotland</a>, which is not part of the Bill’s provisions, will see it continue as the national education agency.</p>

              <p>A national programme of engagement will take place over the next year to inform Scottish Government plans for health and social care reform.</p>
              <p>Through a series of direct engagements with the workforce, service leaders, royal colleges, third sector groups and the people of Scotland, the Scottish Government will collect views on how best to transform services to meet changing demands. This is alongside work already being carried out through the Scottish Partnership Forum to gather views from NHS staff.</p>
              <p>Health Secretary Neil Gray announced the plans as he outlined to Parliament the Scottish Government’s overarching vision for NHS reform which focuses on key areas including; improving population health, prevention and early intervention, providing quality services and maximising access.</p>
              <p>He also confirmed that, as part of on-going work to improve population health, five Scottish institutions will share £5 million of funding to conduct major research programmes. This includes research into improving rural healthcare, managing gestational diabetes in pregnant women and informing how unscheduled care services might better meet people’s needs.</p>
              <p>Mr Gray said:</p>
              <p>“Scotland’s NHS is an institution of national pride and the principles of a health service free at the point of need, must always be protected.</p>

              <p>A national programme of engagement will take place over the next year to inform Scottish Government plans for health and social care reform.</p>
              <p>Through a series of direct engagements with the workforce, service leaders, royal colleges, third sector groups and the people of Scotland, the Scottish Government will collect views on how best to transform services to meet changing demands. This is alongside work already being carried out through the Scottish Partnership Forum to gather views from NHS staff.</p>
              <p>Health Secretary Neil Gray announced the plans as he outlined to Parliament the Scottish Government’s overarching vision for NHS reform which focuses on key areas including; improving population health, prevention and early intervention, providing quality services and maximising access.</p>
              <p>He also confirmed that, as part of on-going work to improve population health, five Scottish institutions will share £5 million of funding to conduct major research programmes. This includes research into improving rural healthcare, managing gestational diabetes in pregnant women and informing how unscheduled care services might better meet people’s needs.</p>
              <p>Mr Gray said:</p>
              <p>“Scotland’s NHS is an institution of national pride and the principles of a health service free at the point of need, must always be protected.</p>

              <p>Protections for people who are in debt and experiencing mental health problems have been approved by the Scottish Parliament.</p>
              <p>The Bankruptcy and Diligence (Scotland) Bill includes the power to bring in a pause on debt recovery action until six months after the person has finished treatment.</p>
              <p>People may be eligible to apply for the mental health moratorium if:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>they are receiving crisis mental health care</li>
              <li>a mental health professional has confirmed that their debt is contributing to their mental illness or is hindering their recovery</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Further detail of how the moratorium will work is included in separate regulations now before MSPs and will be subject to a public consultation.</p>
              <p>The Bill also makes a number of technical changes to the Bankruptcy (Scotland) Act 2016, such as clarifying the time periods for appeals against decisions by the Accountant in Bankruptcy, the organisation responsible for overseeing bankruptcies. It also makes some minor changes to the law covering how debt recovery is carried out in Scotland.</p>
              <p>Public Finance Minister Ivan McKee said:</p>
              <p>“Mental health problems can have a significant impact on a person’s ability to manage their finances. This legislation will give them breathing space during which creditors cannot contact them, enabling them to complete their mental health treatment and access money advice services.</p>
              <p>“There has been broad support for the mental health moratorium and we will continue to work with our partner organisations as we put the new system in place.”</p>
              <p>Chief Executive of the Accountant in Bankruptcy, Richard Dennis, said:</p>
              <p>“It has been good to see those with an understanding of debt and those with an understanding of mental health crises coming together to design an approach that can offer hope to those facing both these concerns.”</p>
              <p>Jo Anderson, Director of Influence and Change at SAMH (Scottish Action for Mental Health), said:</p>
              <p>“The relationship between poor mental health and debt is well established: debt problems can lead to mental health problems, and mental health problems can result in debt. The passage of this Bill, which makes it possible to create a debt moratorium for people with mental health problems that prioritises mental health recovery over the recovery of debt, is really welcome.</p>
              <p>“We look forward to working with the Scottish Government and partners to ensure that a moratorium provides robust protections and is accessible to everyone that needs it.”</p>

This legislation will give them breathing space during which creditors cannot contact them, enabling them to complete their mental health treatment and access money advice services.</p>
              <p>“There has been broad support for the mental health moratorium and we will continue to work with our partner organisations as we put the new system in place.”</p>
              <p>Chief Executive of the Accountant in Bankruptcy, Richard Dennis, said:</p>
              <p>“It has been good to see those with an understanding of debt and those with an understanding of mental health crises coming together to design an approach that can offer hope to those facing both these concerns.”</p>
              <p>Jo Anderson, Director of Influence and Change at SAMH (Scottish Action for Mental Health), said:</p>
              <p>“The relationship between poor mental health and debt is well established: debt problems can lead to mental health problems, and mental health problems can result in debt. The passage of this Bill, which makes it possible to create a debt moratorium for people with mental health problems that prioritises mental health recovery over the recovery of debt, is really welcome.</p>
              <p>“We look forward to working with the Scottish Government and partners to ensure that a moratorium provides robust protections and is accessible to everyone that needs it.”</p>

              <p>Protections for people who are in debt and experiencing mental health problems have been approved by the Scottish Parliament.</p>
              <p>The Bankruptcy and Diligence (Scotland) Bill includes the power to bring in a pause on debt recovery action until six months after the person has finished treatment.</p>
              <p>People may be eligible to apply for the mental health moratorium if:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>they are receiving crisis mental health care</li>
              <li>a mental health professional has confirmed that their debt is contributing to their mental illness or is hindering their recovery</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Further detail of how the moratorium will work is included in separate regulations now before MSPs and will be subject to a public consultation.</p>
              <p>The Bill also makes a number of technical changes to the Bankruptcy (Scotland) Act 2016, such as clarifying the time periods for appeals against decisions by the Accountant in Bankruptcy, the organisation responsible for overseeing bankruptcies. It also makes some minor changes to the law covering how debt recovery is carried out in Scotland.</p>
              <p>Public Finance Minister Ivan McKee said:</p>
              <p>“Mental health problems can have a significant impact on a person’s ability to manage their finances.

              <p>The Scottish Government is estimated to have invested almost £1.4 billion to benefit children in low income households in the last financial year.</p>
              <p>The investment is detailed in an annual progress report which highlights key actions to tackle child poverty including:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>Awarding almost £430 million to families through the Scottish Child Payment, supporting more than 329,000 children as of 31 March 2024</li>
              <li>Widening eligibility for Best Start Foods, the benefit which helps low-income families access nutritious food, so thousands more children and pregnant women can benefit</li>
              <li>Supporting around 4,400 children through continued work to develop a system of school age childcare and continuing to provide 1140 hours of funded childcare for all eligible children</li>
              <li>Providing free bus travel to over 2.3 million people, with 727,000 children and young people registered as of March 2024</li>
              <li>Delivering 6,045 affordable homes across Scotland, with two thirds for social rent, between April and December 2023 – helping an estimated 2,015 households with children into affordable housing</li>

              <p>“Eradicating child poverty is the First Minister’s top priority and the actions we are taking are making a difference. Modelling published in February estimates that our policies will keep 100,000 children out of relative poverty this year.</p>

              <p>The Scottish Government is estimated to have invested almost £1.4 billion to benefit children in low income households in the last financial year.</p>
              <p>The investment is detailed in an annual progress report which highlights key actions to tackle child poverty including:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>Awarding almost £430 million to families through the Scottish Child Payment, supporting more than 329,000 children as of 31 March 2024</li>
              <li>Widening eligibility for Best Start Foods, the benefit which helps low-income families access nutritious food, so thousands more children and pregnant women can benefit</li>
              <li>Supporting around 4,400 children through continued work to develop a system of school age childcare and continuing to provide 1140 hours of funded childcare for all eligible children</li>
              <li>Providing free bus travel to over 2.3 million people, with 727,000 children and young people registered as of March 2024</li>
              <li>Delivering 6,045 affordable homes across Scotland, with two thirds for social rent, between April and December 2023 – helping an estimated 2,015 households with children into affordable housing</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Ms Somerville said:</p>
              <p>“Eradicating child poverty is the First Minister’s top priority and the actions we are taking are making a difference. Modelling published in February estimates that our policies will keep 100,000 children out of relative poverty this year.</p>
              <p>“Over the last year we have continued to provide immediate support to families through investment in the likes of our ‘game-changing’ Scottish Child Payment,</p>
              <p>and by mitigating the Benefit Cap as fully as possible within the scope of devolved powers.</p>
              <p>“We have set out, through our Building a New Scotland series, how we would deliver differently in an independent Scotland. Only with the full economic and fiscal powers of an independent nation can we use all of the levers other governments have to tackle inequalities, and we will continue to make this case. However, this will not stop us from taking all the action we can towards our goal now."</p>

              <p>Following a further increase in the value from 1 April 2024, together the Scottish Government’s five family payments of Scottish Child Payment, Best Start Foods and the three Best Start Grant payments could now be worth over £10,000 by the time an eligible child turns six, and around £25,000 by the time they turn 16.</p>

              <p>More than 10,000 hectares of damaged peatland has been restored in Scotland over the last year, reducing harmful emissions and accelerating progress to net zero.</p>
              <p>Ahead of World Peatlands Day on 2 June, the average rate of peatland restoration has more than doubled in the last two years and, thanks to more than 100 projects across the country, 2023-24 saw 10,360 hectares restored – the highest amount achieved in a single year.</p>
              <p>Peatlands cover nearly two million hectares of Scotland – with nearly three-quarters of these degraded – and account for two-thirds of the UK’s peatland.</p>
              <p>The Scottish Government has pledged £250 million to restore damaged peatlands, which release harmful greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, accounting for around 15% of Scotland’s emissions.</p>
              <p>Agriculture Minister Jim Fairlie said:</p>
              <p>“Restoring degraded peatland is one of the most cost-effective ways we can reduce carbon emissions and fight climate change. There are many benefits, such as reducing flooding risks, improving water quality and improving local biodiversity.</p>
              <p>“Increasing private investment in peatland restoration and maximising the community benefits from these projects is crucial. By increasing the pace and scale of peatland restoration we can restore our natural environment and tackle climate change more effectively and I am very pleased to mark this achievement ahead of World Peatlands Day.</p>
              <p>“I want to thank everyone across the Peatland ACTION partnership for all their hard work and commitment this year on achieving this significant milestone.”</p>
              <p>NatureScot Chair, Professor Colin Galbraith said:</p>
              <p>“As key partners in the Scottish Government’s Peatland ACTION partnership, NatureScot is accelerating the vital work needed to reach the ambitious target of 250,000 hectares of peatland being restored by 2030.</p>
              <p>“Putting Scotland’s degraded peatlands on the road to recovery makes a vitally important contribution to reducing greenhouse gas as well as providing broader benefits for biodiversity and water management.</p>
              <p>“Collectively, these reduce flood and fire risk and increase community resilience to the climate emergency.”</p>

              <p>The Scottish Government funds five direct delivery partners to carry out peatland restoration projects through the Peatland ACTION Partnership - NatureScot, Forestry and Land Scotland, Cairngorms National Park Authority, Loch Lomond and Trossachs National Park Authority and Scottish Water.

              <p>Healthy peatlands have a central role in mitigating and adapting to the linked climate and nature emergencies.&nbsp; In good condition, peatlands provide multiple co-benefits: capturing and storing carbon, supporting nature, reducing flood risk, improving water quality and providing places that can support physical and mental wellbeing.</p>
              <p>Peatlands can be restored in various ways, such as re-wetting the land by installing dams to block drains, smoothing ploughed ridges and furrows, and removing trees and reducing grazing intensity.</p>

              <p><a href="https://www.nature.scot/climate-change/nature-based-solutions/peatland-action/peatland-action-data-research-and-monitoring/peatland-action-data-mapping-portal">Peatland ACTION - Data mapping portal | NatureScot</a></p>
              <p>The Scottish Government funds five direct delivery partners to carry out peatland restoration projects through the Peatland ACTION Partnership - NatureScot, Forestry and Land Scotland, Cairngorms National Park Authority, Loch Lomond and Trossachs National Park Authority and Scottish Water. More information can be found here: <a href="https://www.nature.scot/climate-change/nature-based-solutions/peatland-action">Peatland ACTION</a></p>
              <p>Healthy peatlands have a central role in mitigating and adapting to the linked climate and nature emergencies.&nbsp; In good condition, peatlands provide multiple co-benefits: capturing and storing carbon, supporting nature, reducing flood risk, improving water quality and providing places that can support physical and mental wellbeing.</p>
              <p>Peatlands can be restored in various ways, such as re-wetting the land by installing dams to block drains, smoothing ploughed ridges and furrows, and removing trees and reducing grazing intensity.</p>

              <p>Plans to grow Scotland’s childminding workforce by 1,000 and provide more support to childminders have been announced.</p>
              <p>Backed by more than £1m Scottish Government funding, the Scottish Childminding Association (SCMA) will scale up their successful childminder recruitment pilot programme across the country, starting with 16 local authority areas.</p>
              <p>As well as support through the registration process, a £750 start-up grant will be available for newly-registered childminders completing the programme to help set up their new business.</p>
              <p>For existing childminders, it will provide more practical assistance and include developing a mentoring scheme – helping to reduce workplace isolation and create networks of support, which will be piloted from January 2025.</p>
              <p>Visiting a Childminder in Glasgow, the Minister for Children, Young People and The Promise Natalie Don said:</p>
              <p>“Childminders provide vital support to children and parents and are an important part of Scotland’s thriving Early Learning and Childcare sector.</p>
              <p>“The support provided by the pilot projects to date has made a real difference for the families they help. This investment will not only help us grow the childminding workforce by 1,000, it will also support existing childminders, which is essential as we look to increase the workforce.”</p>
              <p>Graeme McAlister, Chief Executive of the Scottish Childminding Association, said:</p>
              <p>“We are delighted to be at the forefront of delivering the Programme for Scotland’s Childminding Future.&nbsp;We’ve worked hard on behalf of childminders, families and communities around Scotland to secure this important funding which recognises the need to take action to ensure that the childminding workforce has a strong future.</p>
              <p>“Childminding businesses play a vital role in providing high-quality, flexible childcare for families, and contribute to child poverty reduction by enabling parents to work, seek work or stay in work.&nbsp;The programme will enable us to improve the retention of the existing workforce and to work with local authorities to nationally scale-up the childminder recruitment model.”</p>

              <p>XL Bully dog owners are being reminded to apply for an exemption certificate before the deadline on 31 July so they can continue to legally own their dogs.</p>
              <p>From 1 August 2024, it will be a criminal offence to own an XL Bully without an exemption certificate or not to have applied for one by that date.</p>
              <p>To get an exemption certificate, owners can apply online or by post for a £92.40 fee, while they must also obtain third party insurance and neuter and microchip their dogs. The deadline for online applications is midnight 31 July. Postal applications must be received by 15 July.</p>
              <p>Since 1 April, when the exemption application process to own an XL Bully dog opened, 761 dogs have been registered online with 7 postal applications also received.</p>
              <p>In line with the initial safeguards introduced on 23 February, XL Bully dogs must continue to be muzzled and kept on a lead in public.</p>
              <p>Owners who decide not to keep their dogs can apply for compensation.</p>
              <p>Victims and Community Safety Minister Siobhian Brown said:</p>
              <p>“I welcome the fact that 768 owners have already applied for an exemption for their XL Bully dog.</p>
              <p>“We are now half-way through the time period available to apply for an exemption and I encourage owners who have not yet applied to do so now.</p>
              <p>"The scheme is necessary to allow for XL Bully owners to legally keep their dogs in the long term, while agreeing to adhere to the necessary safeguards that will help reduce any risks to public safety.”</p>

              <p>The families of more than 329,000 children under 16 are benefitting from Scottish Child Payment, latest statistics show.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>The weekly payment of £26.70, which is unique to Scotland, is helping families with the cost of living crisis, with over £677 million paid since the payment launched.</p>
              <p>Scottish Child Payment is part of a wider package of payments – including the three Best Start Grants and Best Start Foods – which together have provided over £829 million in vital financial support at key stages of a child’s life. There is no cap on the number of children in one family who can receive these payments.</p>
              <p>In a survey, also released today, the majority of families said that the payments helped their child to take part in social or educational opportunities and also helped them buy milk and healthy food for their children.</p>
              <p>Survey responses also suggest that families are finding it straightforward to apply with more than 90% of people noting the application was clear and did not take too long to complete.</p>
              <p>Social Justice Secretary Shirley-Anne Somerville said:&nbsp;</p>
              <p>“As the First Minister has set out, eradicating child poverty is the number one priority for the Scottish Government.</p>
              <p>“Scottish Child Payment plays a key part in that mission. Together with our Best Start Grant and Best Start Foods payments, this package of financial support, which is worth almost £25,000 per child by the time their child turns 16, is helping to make sure all children in Scotland get the best start in life.</p>
              <p>“We have provided over £829 million to help people raise their families, putting money into the pockets of people who need it most.</p>
              <p>“This crucial cash is available as soon expectant parents know they are pregnant all the way through to their child starting nursery, then going to primary and secondary school and helps them cover costs of caring for their children.</p>
              <p>“We know from our recent research that families say the application process is clear and doesn’t take too long to apply. So I would urge families to apply for our package of five family payments and get the money they are entitled to.”</p>

              <p>The families of more than 329,000 children under 16 are benefitting from Scottish Child Payment, latest statistics show.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>The weekly payment of £26.70, which is unique to Scotland, is helping families with the cost of living crisis, with over £677 million paid since the payment launched.</p>
              <p>Scottish Child Payment is part of a wider package of payments – including the three Best Start Grants and Best Start Foods – which together have provided over £829 million in vital financial support at key stages of a child’s life. There is no cap on the number of children in one family who can receive these payments.</p>
              <p>In a survey, also released today, the majority of families said that the payments helped their child to take part in social or educational opportunities and also helped them buy milk and healthy food for their children.</p>
              <p>Survey responses also suggest that families are finding it straightforward to apply with more than 90% of people noting the application was clear and did not take too long to complete.</p>
              <p>Social Justice Secretary Shirley-Anne Somerville said:&nbsp;</p>
              <p>“As the First Minister has set out, eradicating child poverty is the number one priority for the Scottish Government.</p>
              <p>“Scottish Child Payment plays a key part in that mission. Together with our Best Start Grant and Best Start Foods payments, this package of financial support, which is worth almost £25,000 per child by the time their child turns 16, is helping to make sure all children in Scotland get the best start in life.</p>
              <p>“We have provided over £829 million to help people raise their families, putting money into the pockets of people who need it most.</p>
              <p>“This crucial cash is available as soon expectant parents know they are pregnant all the way through to their child starting nursery, then going to primary and secondary school and helps them cover costs of caring for their children.</p>
              <p>“We know from our recent research that families say the application process is clear and doesn’t take too long to apply. So I would urge families to apply for our package of five family payments and get the money they are entitled to.”</p>

              <p>Scotland’s Chief Statistician today released the main findings of the <a href="https://www.gov.scot/isbn/9781836012832">2023/24 Health and Care Experience survey</a>.</p>
              <p>Experience of General Practice and Out of Hours healthcare:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>69% of people rated their overall experience of their General Practice as good or excellent: this is a slight increase since the last survey in 2021/22 (67%), but it is lower than the survey prior to that in 2019/20 (79%).</li>
              <li>84% of people who needed to see or speak to a doctor / nurse quite urgently were seen within 2 working days: this is slightly lower than in 2021/22 (85%) and in 2019/20 (86%).</li>
              <li>62% received face-to-face appointments at the General Practice: this is a large increase from 2021/22 (37%), but it is lower than in 2019/20 (87%).</li>
              <li>73% of people rated their overall experience of Out of Hours healthcare as good or excellent: this is higher than in 2021/22 (67%), but it is lower than in 2019/20 (79%).</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Experience of help, care and support:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>63% of people rated their help, care or support services as good or excellent.</li>
              <li>64% felt they were supported to live as independently as possible.</li>
              <li>53% felt they had a say in how their help, care or support was provided.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Experience of caring responsibilities:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>62% of carers feel they have a good balance between caring and other things in their life: this is slightly lower than in 2021/22 (63%) and 2019/20 (64%).</li>
              <li>31% of people felt supported to continue caring: a slight increase compared to 2021/22 (30%), but lower than 2019/20 (34%).</li>
              </ul>
              <p><strong>Background</strong></p>
              <p>The Scottish Health and Care Experience Survey is a postal survey, which was sent to a random sample of people who were registered with a General Practice in Scotland, lived in Scotland, and were aged 17 and over on 25 September 2023. Over 107,000 people registered with a General Practice in Scotland responded to the survey.</p>
              <p>The survey has been run every two years since 2009 and forms part of the Scottish Care Experience Survey Programme, which is a suite of national surveys which provide local and national information on the quality of health and care services from the perspective of those using them.</p>
              <p>Questionnaires were sent out in October and November 2023 asking about peoples’ experiences during the previous 12 months.</p>
              <p>Comparisons over time for the help, care and support section are not presented in this publication due to changes in the opening question to this section, which results in a different cohort of people answering this section when compared to previous years.</p>
              <p>As with all surveys, Health and Care Experience Survey results are estimates, based on a sample of the population. Percentages and differences are only described as ‘higher/lower’ or ‘increase/decrease’ where statistical tests identify statistically significant differences. Where a difference is not statistically significant, it is described as being ‘similar to’, even if one figure appears higher or lower than the other.</p>
              <p>The Health and Care Experience Survey is the data source for the National Performance Framework indicator on <a href="https://nationalperformance.gov.scot/national-outcomes/national-outcomes/health/about-national-indicators/quality-care-experience">Quality of Care Experience</a>.</p>
              <p><a href="https://www.gov.scot/isbn/9781836012832">This report presents the key national level findings</a> from the HACE 2023/24 survey. Other outputs of the survey available on the <a href="https://www.gov.scot/collections/health-and-care-experience-survey/">Health and Care Experience Survey collection page</a> are:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>An excel spreadsheet showing results at national level and broken down at Health and Social Care Partnership level, Health Board, General Practice Cluster and General Practice level.</li>
              <li>An excel spreadsheet with data used for the charts and tables in this report.</li>
              <li>A <a href="https://www.gov.scot/isbn/9781836012825">technical report</a> with details of the survey design and methodology.</li>
              </ul>

              <p>Scotland’s Chief Statistician today released the main findings of the <a href="https://www.gov.scot/isbn/9781836012832">2023/24 Health and Care Experience survey</a>.</p>
              <p>Experience of General Practice and Out of Hours healthcare:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>69% of people rated their overall experience of their General Practice as good or excellent: this is a slight increase since the last survey in 2021/22 (67%), but it is lower than the survey prior to that in 2019/20 (79%).</li>
              <li>84% of people who needed to see or speak to a doctor / nurse quite urgently were seen within 2 working days: this is slightly lower than in 2021/22 (85%) and in 2019/20 (86%).</li>
              <li>62% received face-to-face appointments at the General Practice: this is a large increase from 2021/22 (37%), but it is lower than in 2019/20 (87%).</li>
              <li>73% of people rated their overall experience of Out of Hours healthcare as good or excellent: this is higher than in 2021/22 (67%), but it is lower than in 2019/20 (79%).</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Experience of help, care and support:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>63% of people rated their help, care or support services as good or excellent.</li>
              <li>64% felt they were supported to live as independently as possible.</li>
              <li>53% felt they had a say in how their help, care or support was provided.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Experience of caring responsibilities:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>62% of carers feel they have a good balance between caring and other things in their life: this is slightly lower than in 2021/22 (63%) and 2019/20 (64%).</li>
              <li>31% of people felt supported to continue caring: a slight increase compared to 2021/22 (30%), but lower than 2019/20 (34%).</li>
              </ul>
              <p><strong>Background</strong></p>
              <p>The Scottish Health and Care Experience Survey is a postal survey, which was sent to a random sample of people who were registered with a General Practice in Scotland, lived in Scotland, and were aged 17 and over on 25 September 2023. Over 107,000 people registered with a General Practice in Scotland responded to the survey.</p>
              <p>The survey has been run every two years since 2009 and forms part of the Scottish Care Experience Survey Programme, which is a suite of national surveys which provide local and national information on the quality of health and care services from the perspective of those using them.</p>
              <p>Questionnaires were sent out in October and November 2023 asking about peoples’ experiences during the previous 12 months.</p>
              <p>Comparisons over time for the help, care and support section are not presented in this publication due to changes in the opening question to this section, which results in a different cohort of people answering this section when compared to previous years.</p>
              <p>As with all surveys, Health and Care Experience Survey results are estimates, based on a sample of the population. Percentages and differences are only described as ‘higher/lower’ or ‘increase/decrease’ where statistical tests identify statistically significant differences. Where a difference is not statistically significant, it is described as being ‘similar to’, even if one figure appears higher or lower than the other.</p>
              <p>The Health and Care Experience Survey is the data source for the National Performance Framework indicator on <a href="https://nationalperformance.gov.scot/national-outcomes/national-outcomes/health/about-national-indicators/quality-care-experience">Quality of Care Experience</a>.</p>

              <p>Access to technologies which will transform the lives of those living with Type 1 Diabetes is set to be expanded.</p>
              <p>Up to £8.8 million will be used to &nbsp;rollout of loop systems this year to support all children living with Type 1 Diabetes access Closed Loop System technology and increase the provision of these life changing technologies for adults with this condition.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>A closed loop system uses a glucose sensor linked to an insulin pump to automatically calculate how much insulin should be delivered – removing the burden of people needing to calculate their insulin dosage and take injections.</p>
              <p>A national team will enable training, education and support to be given remotely from health professionals, including Diabetes specialist nurses and dietitians, as well as peer support from others living with diabetes.</p>
              <p>Cabinet Secretary Neil Gray spoke to staff at the new Usher Institute building at Edinburgh University. During his speech he outlined his vision for how technology and innovation can help make the NHS more sustainable in the future.</p>
              <p>Mr Gray said:</p>
              <p>“Closed loop systems are an incredible asset for those living with Type 1 Diabetes. It not only improves sugar control and reduces the risk of long term complications, but also removes a lot of the burden that people living with type 1 Diabetes face on a day to day basis.</p>
              <p>“The use of this technology can make it much easier for people to manage their Diabetes, greatly reducing the risk of the health complications that can be associated with the condition.</p>
              <p>“This is an example of the kind of innovation that can help transform healthcare, equipping the NHS to meet the challenges it currently faces. It will also greatly improve the lives of people living with Diabetes, particularly children and their parents.”</p>
              <p><strong>Background</strong></p>
              <p>Type 1 Diabetes is a lifelong condition which affects over 35,000 people in Scotland and around 3,340 children. &nbsp;</p>
              <p>Within the NHS, 70% of Diabetes spend is on preventable complications including treating kidney failure, heart disease, blindness and foot amputations.</p>

              <p>Up to £8.8 million will be used to &nbsp;rollout of loop systems this year to support all children living with Type 1 Diabetes access Closed Loop System technology and increase the provision of these life changing technologies for adults with this condition.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>A closed loop system uses a glucose sensor linked to an insulin pump to automatically calculate how much insulin should be delivered – removing the burden of people needing to calculate their insulin dosage and take injections.</p>
              <p>A national team will enable training, education and support to be given remotely from health professionals, including Diabetes specialist nurses and dietitians, as well as peer support from others living with diabetes.</p>
              <p>Cabinet Secretary Neil Gray spoke to staff at the new Usher Institute building at Edinburgh University. During his speech he outlined his vision for how technology and innovation can help make the NHS more sustainable in the future.</p>
              <p>Mr Gray said:</p>
              <p>“Closed loop systems are an incredible asset for those living with Type 1 Diabetes. It not only improves sugar control and reduces the risk of long term complications, but also removes a lot of the burden that people living with type 1 Diabetes face on a day to day basis.</p>
              <p>“The use of this technology can make it much easier for people to manage their Diabetes, greatly reducing the risk of the health complications that can be associated with the condition.</p>
              <p>“This is an example of the kind of innovation that can help transform healthcare, equipping the NHS to meet the challenges it currently faces. It will also greatly improve the lives of people living with Diabetes, particularly children and their parents.”</p>
              <p><strong>Background</strong></p>
              <p>Type 1 Diabetes is a lifelong condition which affects over 35,000 people in Scotland and around 3,340 children. &nbsp;</p>
              <p>Within the NHS, 70% of Diabetes spend is on preventable complications including treating kidney failure, heart disease, blindness and foot amputations.</p>

              <p>Software to reduce hospital waiting times and enhance operating theatre efficiency will be rolled out in NHS boards across Scotland over the next year.</p>
              <p>Developed by clinician-led tech company Infix, the national theatre scheduling tool improved operating room efficiency by up to 25% without the need for extra medical staff or additional theatres during successful pilots across three health boards. It also enabled the completion of additional operations for patients which resulted in significant financial savings.</p>
              <p>The platform will now support all NHS Boards to increase productivity, remove paper processes, and reduce the overall administrative burden in the creation and approval of theatre lists, which can delay patient treatment.</p>
              <p>In a speech in Edinburgh later today, Health Secretary Neil Gray will outline the role of innovation and collaboration in the future of Scotland’s health service. He said:</p>
              <p>“Better use of data and digital technology is critical to how we drive improvements in healthcare and is a key part of our plans to reform services.</p>
              <p>“This technology is backed by more than five years’ worth of NHS operating times data and is just one of the initiatives that will help enable us to schedule 1.5 million procedures per year - while improving data quality to help safely increase productivity. This will help maximise capacity, build greater resilience and reduce waiting lists.</p>
              <p>“Reducing the administrative burden on staff will give them more time to spend on patient care. This is a shining example of how we are embracing cutting edge tools to tackle the challenges facing health and social care.”</p>
              <p><strong>Background </strong></p>
              <p>A £1.2 million investment will allow the software to be rolled out over the next year.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>The contract was awarded to Infix following a competitive procurement process. It is part of the Scottish Government’s drive to embrace digital and technology driven services to enhance health and social care, as outlined in <em><a href="https://www.gov.scot/publications/scotlands-digital-health-care-strategy/">Scotland’s Digital Health and Care Strategy</a></em> and its supporting Delivery Plan, which was updated earlier this month.</p>
              <p>It also forms part of the Scottish Government’s ongoing commitment to eradicate long waits, which have been exacerbated by the pandemic, to ensure all people receive the treatment they need as soon as possible.</p>
              <p>Health Improvement Scotland’s study: <a href="https://shtg.scot/our-advice/technology-enabled-theatre-scheduling-systems/"><em>Technology-Enabled Theatre Scheduling Systems</em> </a>found that the implementation of Infix’s theatre scheduling technology in NHS Lothian increased operating theatre efficiency increased by 25%. Overall, the implementation of the system resulted in average daily cost savings of around 7% - estimated to be approximately £1.8 million per year.</p>

              <p>Legislation has been passed that will automatically exonerate sub-postmasters who were wrongly convicted as a result of the faulty Horizon IT system, the day after Royal Assent is granted.</p>
              <p>Those whose convictions are quashed under the Post Office (Horizon System) Offences (Scotland) Bill will be able to access the UK Government financial redress scheme.</p>
              <p>After the Scottish Parliament agreed to use its emergency procedure, the Bill has been introduced and passed in just over two weeks – to allow justice and redress to be delivered to victims as swiftly as possible in line with the UK Bill, which did not cover sub-postmasters in Scotland.</p>
              <p>Sub-postmasters who previously sought to appeal their convictions will now also be exonerated, following a Scottish Government amendment to the Bill, brought at Stage two, in Parliament.</p>
              <p>Justice Secretary Angela Constance said:</p>
              <p>“I hope this Bill goes some way to bring justice to innocent sub-postmasters who had their lives ruined by being wrongly convicted of offences of dishonesty on the basis of tainted evidence from the faulty Post Office Horizon system.</p>
              <p>“As the UK Government’s legislation was not extended to cover Scotland, we have worked as quickly as possible to ensure parity for affected sub-postmasters here,&nbsp;who will also be able to access the UK Government’s compensation scheme.</p>
              <p>“The unprecedented step of introducing legislation to right this terrible wrong was necessary to respond to the scale of the scandal and the length of time that victims have waited for justice.</p>
              <p>“We will now be seeking Royal Assent for the Bill as quickly as possible so affected sub-postmasters can have their convictions quashed and then access the compensation they deserve.”</p>
              <p><strong>Background</strong></p>
              <p>The Post Office (Horizon System) Offences (Scotland) Bill will mean relevant convictions are automatically quashed on the day after the legislation is granted Royal Assent and those exonerated will then be able to access the UK Government financial redress scheme, in line with its requirements.</p>
              <p>The legislation will exonerate convicted sub-postmasters where the following criteria are met:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>the conviction was for embezzlement, fraud, theft, uttering or an ancillary offence committed between 23 September 1996 and 31 December 2018</li>
              <li>the person was carrying on a Post Office business, or working in a Post Office for the purpose of a Post Office business</li>
              <li>the conviction was in connection with carrying on, or working for the purpose of the Post Office business</li>
              <li>the Horizon system was being used for the purposes of the Post Office business in the relevant Post Office</li>

              <p>“As the UK Government’s legislation was not extended to cover Scotland, we have worked as quickly as possible to ensure parity for affected sub-postmasters here,&nbsp;who will also be able to access the UK Government’s compensation scheme.</p>
              <p>“The unprecedented step of introducing legislation to right this terrible wrong was necessary to respond to the scale of the scandal and the length of time that victims have waited for justice.</p>

              <p>The Post Office (Horizon System) Offences (Scotland) Bill will mean relevant convictions are automatically quashed on the day after the legislation is granted Royal Assent and those exonerated will then be able to access the UK Government financial redress scheme, in line with its requirements.</p>
              <p>The legislation will exonerate convicted sub-postmasters where the following criteria are met:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>the conviction was for embezzlement, fraud, theft, uttering or an ancillary offence committed between 23 September 1996 and 31 December 2018</li>
              <li>the person was carrying on a Post Office business, or working in a Post Office for the purpose of a Post Office business</li>

              <p>Legislation has been passed that will automatically exonerate sub-postmasters who were wrongly convicted as a result of the faulty Horizon IT system, the day after Royal Assent is granted.</p>
              <p>Those whose convictions are quashed under the Post Office (Horizon System) Offences (Scotland) Bill will be able to access the UK Government financial redress scheme.</p>
              <p>After the Scottish Parliament agreed to use its emergency procedure, the Bill has been introduced and passed in just over two weeks – to allow justice and redress to be delivered to victims as swiftly as possible in line with the UK Bill, which did not cover sub-postmasters in Scotland.</p>
              <p>Sub-postmasters who previously sought to appeal their convictions will now also be exonerated, following a Scottish Government amendment to the Bill, brought at Stage two, in Parliament.</p>

              <p>A new multi-year, above inflation pay strategy for the Scottish public sector will provide certainty for the workforce while improving public services for the people of Scotland, Finance Secretary Shona Robison has said.</p>
              <p>The 2024-25 Public Sector Pay Policy sets out a framework for workers to receive an average 9.3% uplift over three years – providing above inflation protection from forecast inflation rates of 5.7%.</p>
              <p>Finance and Local Government Secretary Shona Robison said the framework can be used to take forward negotiations on pay and non-pay elements relevant to individual sectors and workforces.</p>
              <p>Ms Robison said:</p>
              <p>“The most valuable and important asset of public services is their workforces. Our approach to public sector pay in recent years means that people in key public sector roles in Scotland are now paid 6% more on average than in the rest of the UK demonstrating that we have supported public sector workers during the cost-of-living crisis.</p>
              <p>“This new above inflation multi-year framework offers public sector workers certainty and a considerable degree of pay restoration when set against expected inflation forecasts up to 2027.</p>
              <p>“It also continues our journey to build the Scottish economy and create the prosperity necessary to support people in Scotland – underlining our commitment to strong public services. Scotland thrives when the organisations that support the people of Scotland thrive, and it is my belief this new pay policy will support workers to achieve exactly that.</p>
              <p>“The Scottish Government operates on an effectively fixed budget, limiting what can be delivered through pay policy. We have set out a fair framework within the limits of our budget. A change to UK spending plans would be required to increase spending on public services and public service workers.”</p>

              <p>The law surrounding the misuse of pyrotechnics at football&nbsp;will be the focus of a new short-life working group set up by the Scottish Government.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>The group will consider the evidence on, and possible barriers to, the use of Football Banning Orders as a penalty for pyrotechnic possession and misuse.</p>
              <p>It is already a criminal offence to take or try to take a pyrotechnic into football matches, while carrying pyrotechnics in public without a reasonable excuse was recently made an offence through the Fireworks and Pyrotechnic Articles (Scotland) Act 2022. The Act gives police powers to stop and search someone where they have reasonable grounds to believe that the person may be in possession of a pyrotechnic in a public place.</p>
              <p>Football Banning Orders (FBOs) can be imposed by a Court for up to ten years for violent offences at matches, which could include throwing a lit pyrotechnic as a weapon. The working group will consider if extending the scope of FBOs would be an effective way to further deter the carrying and misuse of pyrotechnics at football. &nbsp;</p>
              <p>The expert working group includes representation from the Scottish Professional Football League (SPFL) and Scottish Football Association, Football Safety Officers Association, Police Scotland and the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service and is expected to report next year.</p>
              <p>Community Safety Minister Siobhian Brown said:&nbsp;</p>
              <p>“Everyone should be able to enjoy the excitement and atmosphere of a football match without the fear of serious injury from pyrotechnics.</p>
              <p>“We have considerably strengthened pyrotechnic laws, and those who carry fireworks and pyrotechnics in public and into football stadia can face fines and up to six months in prison. Despite this, pyrotechnic misuse at football matches remains an issue.</p>
              <p>“We have been working closely with football’s governing authorities and with police on what more can be done to stop this antisocial and dangerous behaviour at football matches.</p>
              <p>“Football Banning Orders of up to 10 years, are already an effective measure courts have at their disposal to deal with violent behaviour and I have asked this working group to consider whether extending their reach would be a further deterrent to pyrotechnic possession and misuse.</p>
              <p>“Consisting of representatives from football and the justice sector, their review will also take views from clubs, fan groups, as well as front-line services.”&nbsp;</p>
              <p>Calum Beattie Chief Operating Officer of the SPFL, said:</p>
              <p>“The dangers of pyrotechnics in crowded football stadia are significant and our clubs are keen to work with the Scottish Government, police and the courts to find meaningful ways of tackling this growing problem.</p>
              <p>“Recent surveys have also shown that most fans believe there is no place for these devices at games. We are looking forward to playing an active role in this group to examine further how football banning orders can form part of a package of deterrence for any fans tempted to smuggle these dangerous items into grounds.”</p>
              <p>Superintendent Chris Stewart of Police Scotland said:</p>
              <p>"The public have the right to feel safe when they attend football matches and we work with a range of partners, including the clubs, to make sure these events are safe and secure. We will engage with the review and support partners involved."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
              <p><strong>Background</strong></p>
              <p>Membership of the group, which can also consider other issues with FBOs as it sees fit, is made up of representation from the Scottish Professional Football League and Scottish Football Association, Football Safety Officers Association, Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service, Police Scotland, British Transport Police, Scottish Government.</p>

              <p>MSPs have backed legislation giving councils a new power to introduce a visitor levy that would raise funding for local visitor facilities and services.</p>
              <p>The Visitor Levy (Scotland) Bill will enable local authorities to apply a levy on overnight stays with all money raised to be reinvested in services and facilities largely used by tourists and business visitors. Similar levies already apply in tourist destinations across Europe, including Amsterdam and Berlin as well as in countries outside of Europe, such as Canada.</p>
              <p>Councils that want to introduce a visitor levy will be able to do so after they have consulted with local communities, businesses and tourism organisations.</p>
              <p>An 18-month implementation period will then apply before any local authorities can introduce a visitor levy scheme in their area. This is to provide adequate time for councils and businesses to put in place the systems needed to collect and administer a levy.</p>
              <p>An expert group of representatives from the tourism industry, COSLA and other partners will continue to work together to produce guidance for local authorities putting in place a visitor levy scheme.</p>
              <p>Investment Minister Tom Arthur said:</p>
              <p>“We share a vision with the tourism industry for Scotland to be a global leader in tourism and one of the most economically, environmentally and socially sustainable destinations in the world. A visitor levy can help achieve that vision by empowering councils to raise funding, if they wish to do so, that can be invested in local visitor services and activities.</p>
              <p>“This Bill has been a clear example of partnership working between the Scottish Government, local authorities and the tourism industry, in line with the New Deal for Local Government and New Deal for Business.</p>
              <p>“We have sought to deliver as much flexibility to local authorities as possible and to listen to businesses to make it as easy as possible for them to adopt these measures.”</p>
              <p>Councillor Katie Hagmann, COSLA’s Resources Spokesperson, said:</p>
              <p>“I am extremely pleased that the Visitor Levy Bill has now passed through stage 3 in Parliament. With the introduction of these new Visitor Levy powers, councils across Scotland will have the ability to use a discretionary mechanism, that is firmly based on local flexibility.</p>
              <p>“The opportunity of these new powers recognise the great diversity of Scotland’s communities, acknowledging that a one-size-fits all approach does not work. It will allow councils to respond to the needs and circumstances of both the local communities and our important visitor economies.</p>
              <p>“The revenue raised through the introduction of visitor levy powers will be to the mutual benefit of residents, tourists and businesses. There will be opportunities for much-needed additional investment, potentially available across a range of facilities and services, from transport and culture to maintaining and improving our world-famous natural heritage and environment.</p>
              <p>“The visitor levy is a crucial step towards greater empowerment for local government, and we will continue to progress joint work with the Scottish Government in ensuring the smooth progression of these powers into the hands of councils across Scotland.”</p>

              <p>The earliest a visitor levy could come into force would be spring 2026.</p>
              <p>As a result of amendments supported by the Scottish Government at stage 3, the Bill will include:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>an exemption from paying a visitor levy for people in receipt of disability benefits from the UK or Scottish Governments</li>
              <li>a power for Ministers to cap the number of nights to which a visitor levy would apply, after consultation with councils, tourism businesses and tourism organisations and after Parliamentary approval</li>
              <li>a requirement for any council setting up a visitor levy scheme to establish a visitor levy forum which will discuss and advise the council on matters related to a levy in its area</li>
              <li>a requirement for the Scottish Government to review the Visitor Levy Bill no later than three years after the date of the first scheme coming into effect</li>

              <p>First Minister John Swinney will announce a £5 million package for Scotland’s island communities during a visit to Shetland.</p>
              <p>The funding package will support Island communities to tackle local issues and invest in new opportunities that will help deliver a more prosperous future. This funding reflects the First Minister’s four priorities of eradicating child poverty, growing Scotland’s economy, investing in green energy and infrastructure and improving public services.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>While in Shetland, the First Minister will announce:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>a new £1 million scheme to support the six carbon neutral islands to reach net zero by 2040 during a visit to Lerwick Harbour, which plays a pivotal role in Shetland’s green energy transition</li>
              <li>an additional £1 million round of the Island Cost Crisis Emergency Fund to help communities tackle increasing costs, distributed to the six island authorities on a population basis, helping to tackle poverty</li>
              <li>additional £3 million funding to support locally designed critical island infrastructure projects during a visit to COPE Shetland, the Island’s leading centre for community reuse and recycling</li>
              </ul>
              <p>First Minister John Swinney said:</p>
              <p>“I have made it clear that I will be First Minister for everyone in Scotland – including our island communities who face a number of unique challenges but have enormous potential.</p>
              <p>“Islanders have been clear that more needs to be done to help them fulfil their ambitions and that is why we are developing a new National islands Plan, to be published next year.</p>
              <p>“We will listen to island communities, and speak with local authorities to ensure the new plan meets their needs.</p>
              <p>“In the meantime we will continue to invest in our Islands Programme, which over the last three financial years, has distributed over £12 million to support of 61 projects on 50 islands.”</p>

              <p>Applications for medical training posts in Scotland are at record levels with more junior doctors joining the NHS than ever before.</p>
              <p>Data from NHS Education for Scotland shows that 1,231 posts were advertised throughout 2023 and 94% (1,156) of these filled successfully. This includes all entry-level posts in anaesthetics, radiology, emergency medicine, surgery and psychiatry. GP training programmes have been filled at 100% for the first time.</p>
              <p>Welcoming the figures, First Minister Humza Yousaf said:</p>
              <p>“It’s clear from these results that Scotland continues to perform strongly in the field of medical education and training. This reflects the dedication of our NHS staff who deliver high quality training while also caring for their patients alongside our continued investment in expanding our medical workforce and improving conditions.</p>
              <p>“Last year BMA Junior Doctors accepted a record pay deal in Scotland, the single biggest investment in Junior Doctor pay since the Scottish Parliament was established in 1999. This maintains our commitment to make Scotland the best place in the UK for Junior Doctors to work and train.</p>
              <p>“I’m delighted to see so many junior doctors are choosing to practice medicine in Scotland and I’d like to take this opportunity to welcome these new doctors into our health service.”</p>
              <p>Executive Medical Director NHS Education for Scotland Professor Emma Watson said:</p>
              <p>"These excellent results demonstrate that doctors are attracted to working and living in Scotland. However, we must continue to support the wellbeing of staff who deliver care in our health system as well as their thriving careers.</p>
              <p>“We would strongly encourage school leavers and people looking to change jobs to consider careers in medicine, nursing and other health and care professions in Scotland."</p>

              <p>Applications for medical training posts in Scotland are at record levels with more junior doctors joining the NHS than ever before.</p>
              <p>Data from NHS Education for Scotland shows that 1,231 posts were advertised throughout 2023 and 94% (1,156) of these filled successfully. This includes all entry-level posts in anaesthetics, radiology, emergency medicine, surgery and psychiatry. GP training programmes have been filled at 100% for the first time.</p>
              <p>Welcoming the figures, First Minister Humza Yousaf said:</p>
              <p>“It’s clear from these results that Scotland continues to perform strongly in the field of medical education and training. This reflects the dedication of our NHS staff who deliver high quality training while also caring for their patients alongside our continued investment in expanding our medical workforce and improving conditions.</p>
              <p>“Last year BMA Junior Doctors accepted a record pay deal in Scotland, the single biggest investment in Junior Doctor pay since the Scottish Parliament was established in 1999. This maintains our commitment to make Scotland the best place in the UK for Junior Doctors to work and train.</p>
              <p>“I’m delighted to see so many junior doctors are choosing to practice medicine in Scotland and I’d like to take this opportunity to welcome these new doctors into our health service.”</p>
              <p>Executive Medical Director NHS Education for Scotland Professor Emma Watson said:</p>
              <p>"These excellent results demonstrate that doctors are attracted to working and living in Scotland. However, we must continue to support the wellbeing of staff who deliver care in our health system as well as their thriving careers.</p>
              <p>“We would strongly encourage school leavers and people looking to change jobs to consider careers in medicine, nursing and other health and care professions in Scotland."</p>
